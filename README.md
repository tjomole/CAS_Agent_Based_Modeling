# CAS_Agent_Based_Modeling
A Complex Adaptive System - Agent-Based Model (implemented in NetLogo), that simulated and observed the systems-level impacts of the interactions between Banks and Depositors in a Banking Eco-system.

# Overview
An Agent-Based Modeling of Deposit Interest Rate & Bank Stability: Depositors’ Behavior. The Agent-Based Model attempted to observe the systems-level impacts of the interactions between Banks and Depositors in a Banking Eco-system.

Project Rationale: Observing the Interactions of Banks and Depositors – Using Agent-Based Modeling (in NetLogo) Technique.

Covered a review of what, why and who will use the system. The model can help to gain an informed understanding of the complex interactions between.

Domain Review – Context & Background:
At a micro-level, the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)’s failure is shown as an example of a dimension of the banking industry being a Complex System: small change(s) in some drivers  much bigger system-level impacts.

Model Features & Key Considerations:
Covers the environment chosen – open, the description of agents and their attributes. Behavior of the key elements, and the procedures underlying the simulation considered.

Model Design and Results:
Some emergent properties at the aggregate / banking sector level highlighted.
The impact of bank stability factor, used by depositors to calibrate their risk-aversion coefficient, on the share of the wallet deposited at system-wide level, was observed.


# Coding:

What Is It: This model, that I have named the Deposit Interest-Stability Model (DISM), simulates the interactions of depositors and banks, where deposit and withdrawal decisions are principally influenced by a bank’s deposit interest rate, and a bank’s stability factor.

How It Works: Depositors choose where and when to deposit or withdraw their money. Banks accept deposits, honor withdrawal requests, update the total deposits held at their bank. Banks set risk appetite via investment mix (gilt & bonds/loans/other).

Key Features: Deposit-money and withdraw-money procedures – set as random amount of money to withdraw, subject to being no more than the depositor has available at a bank.

# Limitations
Limitations include – limited literature review coupled with limited review and exploration of several aspects of the model, and an in-depth study of the domain to help, not least in testing, validation and verification of the model.

# Next Steps
Next Steps model should be validated and verified to ensure robustness. The model is a relatively simple model looking only at deposit decision drivers. Other factors are likely to be at play, even at the fractal level.
